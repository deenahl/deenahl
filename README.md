I'm a 4th-year CS student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In the past 4 years, I developed a strong interest in machine learning, web development, and more recently, game development! I love building solutions to everyday problems, building fun little projects, and learning new technologies. I enjoy taking care of plants, playing video games, and playing volleyball in my free time, although I'm not all that great at any of these activities just yet 😅. 

## Skills ✨
**Languages:** Python, C++, OpenGL, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#

**Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Node.js, Scikit-learn, Scikit-survival, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Flask

## Completed Projects 👩‍💻
<img src="https://github.com/deenahl/deenahl/blob/main/gen.png" width="20" height="20"> **Path-Of-Gen:** Welcome to Path-Of-Gen, where you play as a pathogen named Gen. Traverse through the challenges of each organ and make your way to the brain to choose your own final path. This project was completed for a course with 5 other classmates. Unfortunately, the original Github repo is under the UBC Organization but the game can be found and downloaded through this link:  [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sJcZRBS94dM34GiZvK3UosdZdxuKl-YO)
- Languages: C++, OpenGL

**Heart Disease Prediction:** Created a data science model for predicting heart disease in patients for an Introductory Data Science Course. Techniques such as problem definition, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation were used to create a model with 0.74 accuracy and 0.76 recall.

- Languages: R
- Tools: Jupyter Lab

**Personal Website:** An outdated personal profile website, made in my first year studying CS. (Feel free to lightly roast me)
- Languages: HTML, CSS

## Current Projects
**Customer Churn Model:** Using Applied Machine Learning techniques to create a Survival Analysis model that predicts the probability of E-commerce users churning. I'm currently testing the model and making it robust to other datasets. Future direction includes creating an API that predicts individual user probabilities, and a simple UI to show when to give a customer a "deal" to keep them from churning.
